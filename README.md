## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- PostgreSQL database
- LLM API access (University of Florida AI API or compatible endpoint)
- PDFRest API key (for PDF-to-image conversion)
- Stripe account (for payments)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anayy09/medlyze.git
cd medlyze
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

**Note:** The `legacy-peer-deps` flag is required due to peer dependency constraints with React 19.

3. Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="your-postgresql-connection-string"

# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-nextauth-secret"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# LLM Configuration
LLM_API_URL="https://xxx.xxx/api/chat/completions"
LLM_API_KEY="your-llm-api-key"
LLM_MODEL="gpt-5"

# PDF Processing
PDFREST_API_KEY="your-pdfrest-api-key"

# File Encryption
ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-32-character-encryption-key"
```

4. Set up the database:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
npx prisma db seed
```

5. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
